#FSharp Type Providers
Type Providers are gagical componets that provide types, properties and methods that are created dynamically from data source and allow for "information rich programming."

1. Typically if you have a new information source, you have to code the underlying structure to represent the data coming from that source.
2. Sometimes you can use a code generator to create the necessary code for you.
3. Code generators do not lend themsleves to the exploratory style of programming inherent to F#.
